# ParserW
I have done this project for the course of Formal Methods at University of Bari and it is my implementation of a monadic parser for while language, a small imperative programming language. 

The general structure of this parser follows the definition given by Graham Hutton in his book [**Programming in Haskell**](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html).

I'll add as soon as possibile a compiler for this language.
